- **Repository:**
- **Paper:** [Paper](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/static/bossard_eccv14_food-101.pdf)

### Dataset Summary

This dataset consists of 101 food categories, with 101'000 images. For each class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training images. On purpose, the training images were not cleaned, and thus still contain some amount of noise. This comes mostly in the form of intense colors and sometimes wrong labels. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `image-classification`: The goal of this task is to classify a given image of a dish into one of 101 classes. The leaderboard is available [here](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/fine-grained-image-classification-on-food-101).

### Languages

English

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A sample from the training set is provided below:

```
{
  'image': <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=384x512 at 0x276021C5EB8>,
  'label': 23
}
```

### Data Fields

The data instances have the following fields:

- `image`: A `PIL.Image.Image` object containing the image. Note that when accessing the image column: `dataset[0]["image"]` the image file is automatically decoded. Decoding of a large number of image files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the `"image"` column, *i.e.* `dataset[0]["image"]` should **always** be preferred over `dataset["image"][0]`.
- `label`: an `int` classification label.

# Welcome to Autonomod — Empowering Ethical and Accountable Artificial Intelligence Development

Autonomod was born from the vision of Dr. Derrick Bass, Ph.D. Student  in Industrial and Organizational Psychology at Walden University, amid his ongoing research on ethical guidelines for autonomous development and its potential impacts on user behavior.

With today's ever-growing prevalence of AI in numerous facets of life, addressing the ethical concerns surrounding autonomy and its influence on humanity is imperative. Autonomod emerges as a trailblazer driving thoughtfulness in AI development.

Autonomod's Core Values
At its heart, Autonomod stands firm on four cornerstone principles:

Accountability: Holding creators, operators, and regulators responsible for designing, deploying, and supervising AI systems ethically and legally.

Transparency: Making AI and autonomous systems development processes accessible, traceable, and verifiable to prevent misinformation, malicious intentions, and unethical behaviors.

Privacy Preservation: Protecting sensitive data and guarding individual privacy rights while honoring organizational interests and societal norms.

Beneficial Impact: Maximizing the net positive effects of AI applications, minimizing harm and negative consequences, and advocating for equitable distribution of gains and losses.


Traditionally, AI development lacks sufficient attention towards ethical ramifications, potentially causing widespread damage. Some pressing issues addressed by Autonomod include:

- Insufficient regulation and oversight
- Unchecked bias and discrimination
- Privacy violations
- Manipulative persuasion tactics
- Job displacement due to automation


Autonomod exists to facilitate:

- Responsible AI development guided by a strong moral compass
- Public awareness of ethical AI matters and their roles as stakeholders
- Academia-industry dialogue and cooperation
- Research breakthroughs benefiting policymakers, businesses, educators, and consumers alike

Why Should People Care About Autonomod?

Everyone has a stake in shaping a harmonious relationship between humans and AI. From everyday citizens encountering facial recognition cameras to CEOs deciding whether to adopt self-service technologies, everyone should confidently engage in AI discussions. Autonomod catalyzes productive conversations, policy formation, and practical solutions to safeguard humankind's welfare and prosperity.


While pursuing his doctoral studies at Walden University, Dr. Derrick Bass embarked on a quest to investigate the psychological factors influencing the adoption and ethical guidelines of autonomous systems. Inspired by Walden's Vision and Mission statements, he saw an urgent need to bridge academia and practice in tackling the moral quandaries posed by rapidly developing AI technology. Thus began Autonomod's journey – championing ethical AI development, raising awareness, and igniting dialogues worldwide.

Roadmap
Autonomod follows a phased approach to development. Our roadmap highlights planned milestones and features that will be delivered incrementally.

Phase 1: Foundation Laying (Complete)
Establish the basic infrastructure and core functionalities required to build and train AI models.

Initial prototype
Basic data preprocessing
Simple regression and classification models
Experimental design and randomization
Phase 2: Model Building Blocks (Current Phase)
Implement popular machine learning algorithms and tools to extend Autonomod's capabilities.

Common machine learning models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines
Dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
Time series modeling: ARIMA, VAR, State Space Models, Kalman Filters
Natural Language Processing: Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition
Phase 3: Deployment and Scalability (Planned)
Optimize Autonomod for production use and horizontal scaling.
