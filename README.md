# Welcome to Autonomod ‚Äî Empowering Ethical and Accountable Artificial Intelligence Development

Autonomod was born from the vision of Dr. Derrick Bass, Ph.D. Student  in Industrial and Organizational Psychology at Walden University, amid his ongoing research on ethical guidelines for autonomous development and its potential impacts on user behavior.

With today's ever-growing prevalence of AI in numerous facets of life, addressing the ethical concerns surrounding autonomy and its influence on humanity is imperative. Autonomod emerges as a trailblazer driving thoughtfulness in AI development.

Autonomod's Core Values
At its heart, Autonomod stands firm on four cornerstone principles:

Accountability: Holding creators, operators, and regulators responsible for designing, deploying, and supervising AI systems ethically and legally.

Transparency: Making AI and autonomous systems development processes accessible, traceable, and verifiable to prevent misinformation, malicious intentions, and unethical behaviors.

Privacy Preservation: Protecting sensitive data and guarding individual privacy rights while honoring organizational interests and societal norms.

Beneficial Impact: Maximizing the net positive effects of AI applications, minimizing harm and negative consequences, and advocating for equitable distribution of gains and losses.


Traditionally, AI development lacks sufficient attention towards ethical ramifications, potentially causing widespread damage. Some pressing issues addressed by Autonomod include:

- Insufficient regulation and oversight
- Unchecked bias and discrimination
- Privacy violations
- Manipulative persuasion tactics
- Job displacement due to automation


Autonomod exists to facilitate:

- Responsible AI development guided by a strong moral compass
- Public awareness of ethical AI matters and their roles as stakeholders
- Academia-industry dialogue and cooperation
- Research breakthroughs benefiting policymakers, businesses, educators, and consumers alike
- Societal improvements brought forth by ethical AI innovations

Why Should People Care About Autonomod?

Everyone has a stake in shaping a harmonious relationship between humans and AI. From everyday citizens encountering facial recognition cameras to CEOs deciding whether to adopt self-service technologies, everyone should confidently engage in AI discussions. Autonomod catalyzes productive conversations, policy formation, and practical solutions to safeguard humankind's welfare and prosperity.


While pursuing his doctoral studies at Walden University, Dr. Derrick Bass embarked on a quest to investigate the psychological factors influencing the adoption and ethical guidelines of autonomous systems. Inspired by Walden's Vision and Mission statements, he saw an urgent need to bridge academia and practice in tackling the moral quandaries posed by rapidly developing AI technology. Thus began Autonomod's journey ‚Äì championing ethical AI development, raising awareness, and igniting dialogues worldwide.
